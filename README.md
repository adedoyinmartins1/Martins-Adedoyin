# Geographical Market Analysis
### Project Overview
This project is being set up by a company to analyse and survey its marketing strengths by identifying the regions and countries where its products are purchased most frequently. Additionally, the company aims to understand the demographics, particularly the gender, that shows greater interest in their products. This information will help the company improve its products and determine where to focus its marketing efforts.
### Objective
*Identifying high-performing markets and key demographic segments.

*To optimise product offerings and marketing strategies.
### Scope of the Analysis
+ Geographical Market Performance Evaluation: Analyse sales data across global markets, separated by regions (e.g., continents, countries) to determine high-performing areas and markets with growth potential.
+ Demographic Profiling: Demographic variables, such as gender, are used to profile the customer base and identify dominant consumer segments.
+ Consumer Purchase Behaviour Analysis: Analyse transactional data to uncover behavioural insights, such as repeat purchases, product category performance, and regional variations in consumer preferences.
+ Market Strength Assessment: Compare sales performance and market share across regions, potentially incorporating competitor data to assess the company’s standing in the market.
### Methodology
1.	**Data Collection** - Aggregated internal sales data segmented by country, region, and product line and collection of demographic information (especially gender) from customer databases, surveys, and analytics tools.
2.	**Data Cleaning & Preparation** -  Removed incomplete or duplicated records to ensure high-quality analysis, and categorised data into relevant groups (e.g., by continent, economic region, or customer segment).
3.	**Data Analysis** - Demographic Analysis performed gender-based segmentation to assess interest levels and buying patterns, and used time-series analysis to detect emerging markets or shifts in consumer behaviour over time.
4.	**Recommendations** - Provided actionable insights to support marketing strategies and product positioning, suggested regions for potential expansion or increased advertising efforts based on high interest or emerging trends, and lastly highlighted gender-based marketing opportunities to align messaging with consumer interests.
