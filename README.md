# Geographical Market Analysis
### Project Overview
This project is being set up by a company to analyse and survey its marketing strengths by identifying the regions and countries where its products are purchased most frequently. Additionally, the company aims to understand the demographics, particularly the gender, that shows greater interest in their products. This information will help the company improve its products and determine where to focus its marketing efforts.
